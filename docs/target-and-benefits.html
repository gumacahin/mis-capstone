 <h3>Benefits to Customers</h3>
 <div class="todo" style="display:none;">
  TODO: List high-level benefits that this product will provide.  For
  each, identify the type of customer or user that will benefit.  Each
  benefit should be in real-world terms, not involving just this
  product itself.  You may want to highlight benefits that are not
  offered by competing products. Benefits to the development
  organization should be listed in <a href="plan.html#risks">Risks and
  Rewards</a>.

 The development of the proposed web-application would allow second phase of the study
 ‘“What should I do today?” A Case Study on the Current Practices and Software
 Requirements Specification of a Web-Based Planner and Productivity Tracker’ to
 take place. The web-application could help increase the productivity of those
 in the field of education while helping them stay organized which could lead
 to the following benefits:


 <ul class="sample1">
  <li>Increase in productivity
   <ul>
    <li>People can be more productive when they remind themselves of their tasks</li>

    <li>People can stay organized and motivated</li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Administration have a better overview of employee productivity
   <ul>
    <li>This could be beneficial in terms of planning and management</li>

    <li>If productivity can be measured it can be improved upon</li>

   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>
