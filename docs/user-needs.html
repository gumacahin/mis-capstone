  <strong>Process impact:</strong> The statement of
  user needs documents and explains the actual desires of stakeholders
  in roughly their own words.  What they <i>desire</i> is never exactly
  what the product <i>provides</i>.  Documenting user needs here,
  independently from the <a href="srs.html">SRS</a>, helps to keep the
  SRS precise and makes the tasks of verification and validation more
  effective.  This document is <em>not</em> an informal draft of the
  SRS, it is different document with a complementary purpose.

 <h3>Agreed Goals</h3>

 <div class="todo" style="display:none">
  TODO: Has there been a clear statement of the overall goal of this
  project that the stakeholders agree to?  If so, paste it here or add
  a hyperlink.  If not, you should summarize your understanding of the
  project goals into a brief statement and try to get the stakeholders
  to agree to it.  The text below gives three alternative examples,
  select one, or write your own.

 <h3>Environment</h3>

  TODO: Briefly describe various aspects of the environment where the
  software will be used.  Describe the environment as it <i>is</i> or
  <i>will be</i>, not what you would wish it to become.  The text
  below gives a few examples.

 <dl>

  <dt>What is the system's business environment?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">The UPOU faculty needs to manage their time between research,
    extention and administrative work. A productivity tracker could help keep track
    of these activities and help identify which category of activities they should
    focus on.
  </dd>

  <dd class="sample1">UPOU administrators needs to measure and keep track of
    faculty productivty in order to identify areas of improvement.
  </dd>

  <dt>What is the system's physical environment?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">This system will not run on a physical web server but will
    instead be hosted one the cloud. In particular, the applicaton will be
    deployed in <a href="https://forge.laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel Forge</a>.
    Users of the system will be using desktop or mobile browsers access it.

  <dt>What is the system's technology environment (hardware and software)?</dt>

  <dd>A majority of the users will be using their work desktop or laptop. Modern
    work machines have enough computing power to run day-to-day tasks including
    modern browers from which the web-application will be accessed. Outside of
    their work machines, users will access the application through a mobile
    browser on their personal smart phones.

 <h3>Stakeholders / Actors</h3>

 <div class="todo" style="display:none">
  TODO: List and describe the stakeholders for this product.  These
  can be named individuals or roles that people play.  For each
  stakeholder, list/rank their key needs.  Consider the expected
  technical expertise of the stakeholders and how often they are
  likely to use the system, as well as key strengths, weaknesses,
  preferences, or other characteristics.  Use a greater-than sign to
  indicate inheritance among types of actors.
 </div>

 <div class="tip" style="display:none">
  TIP: To get information on types of users, you can talk to actual
  users.  You may also want to talk to user surrogates (people who
  work with users), such as domain experts, technical trainers,
  technical support staff, technical writers, supervisors of users,
  and your own sales and marketing department.  You can find clues in
  manuals and marketing materials for competing products.
