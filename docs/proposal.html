 <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>

 <div class="todo" style="display:none">
  TODO: Replace the example text below with text that describes your
  project.  What are the needs or problems that you are trying to
  address?  Why do these needs (still) exist?  Why are these problems
  worth solving?  Who is the customer?  Write 2-4 paragraphs.
 </div>

 <dl>

  <dt>What is the setting and history behind this project?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">The project is focused on developing a web-based
    application called &ldquo;WSIDT&rdquo; for the University of the Philippines
    Open University (UPOU) community to provide an efficient and beneficial
    task-management and productivity-tracking tool. Currently, there are
    task-managing and productivity-tracking applications available in the market,
    but they fail to meet the feature requirements prioritized by the UPOU
    faculty and staff for effective planning and productivity tracking.
    The project aims to propose a potential solution to address the feature
    requirements that the majority of the intended users need, in order
    to fill the gap and provide a system that can meet their requirements.</dd>


  <dt>What is the problem to be addressed?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">The problem to be addressed is the absence of a task-management and productivity-tracking tool that meets the specific feature requirements prioritized by the UPOU community. This lack of a suitable tool can result in inefficient planning and reduced productivity. By developing an application that fulfills these feature needs, the project aims to provide the UPOU community with an effective tool to improve productivity, planning, and overall efficiency.</dd>


  <dt>What are some current approaches to this problem?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">The current approach is the traditional pen-and-paper, spreadsheet applications and the use off available task-management and productivity-tracking applications.

  <ul>
   <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10Vh-24a0K9SPp--s15L5QexI3OT7TKtpMgr8ZGf6z0o/edit#gid=0">Google Sheets Template</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://todoist.com/home">Todist.com</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://trello.com">Trello.com</a></li>
  </ul>

  </dd>


  <dt>Why is this problem worth solving or worth solving better?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">The problem of the lack of a suitable task-management and productivity-tracking tool with the needed feature set is worth solving because it directly impacts the productivity and efficiency of the UPOU community. By providing a tool that meets their specific requirements, it has the potential to improve the quality of work output and reduce the time spent on manual tracking and management of tasks. This can ultimately lead to improved performance and productivity in the long run. Additionally, a web-based application like WSIDT can offer more accessibility and convenience to the users, as they can access it anytime and anywhere. Thus, solving this problem can lead to significant benefits for both the UPOU community and the organization as a whole.</dd>


  <dt>How will this product be better than previous approaches?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">Better fitting feature set: By introducing features that
    are not currently available in the market but are prioritized by the UPOU
    community, the application can offer users a unique value proposition.</dd>

  <dd class="sample2">Improved maintainability, scalability, and security: While the functionality
    of the new product may be similar to existing products, it can still surpass
    previous approaches by enhancing aspects such as maintainability, scalability,
    and security.</dd>


  <dd>Our system will have similar functionality, but it is specifically aimed at
    the UPOU community, which is not adequately served by existing systems.</dd>

  <dt>Where is there more information on this problem?</dt>

 <h3>Goal</h3>
 <dl>

  <dt>What is the goal of this project?</dt>

  <div class="tip" style="display:none">
   TIP: This should be relatively short since you can reference terms
   defined above.
  </div>

  <dd>This project aims to develop a web-based application for task-management
    and productivity-tracking that caters to the specific needs and priorities
    of the UPOU community. The application will provide a comprehensive set of
    features that will help community members manage their tasks and track
    their productivity, while also allowing administrators to gain insights on
    overall productivity based on anonymized app usage data. The goal is to
    improve the efficiency and effectiveness of task management and productivity
    tracking within the UPOU community, ultimately leading to improved
    performance and outcomes.</dd>

  <dt>What are the defining features and benefits of this product?</dt>

  <dd>
  <ul class="sample1">
   <li>Feature list matches the features the UPOU community priortizes the most.</li>

   <li>Integration with the Univerity's Googe Calendar.</li>

   TODO: Briefly list and rank major risks.  Risks are detailed in the

   document, you should select the most important risks from the
   project plan and explain them in non-technical terms.
  </div>

  <dt>What are the main risks of this project?</dt>

  <dd class="sample1">
   <ol>
    <li>With the availability of various high production value tools, there is
        potential for the low uptake of the developed application. Success relies
        heavily on the usability and user satisfaction with regards to the design
        and performance of the web application.
    </li>

    <li>There are significant technical difficulties in building a web
    site and web application. A one person team developing the application will
    be a risk because there is potential for development to stall as other life
    events could get in the way of development.</li>

    <li>The schedule for this project is very short.  We will manage
    this by planning a conservatively scoped functional core and series
    of functional enhancements that can be individually slipped to later
    releases if needed.</li>
   </ol>
  </dd>


  <dt>What are the main rewards if this project succeeds?</dt>


  <dd class="sample1">If I accomplish the elements of my plan, the application
  has the potential to increase the productivity of members of the UPOU productivity
  and increase the overall employee and student satisfaction of employees and
  students. There is also potential for further studies of how well-fitting
  information system could improve various aspects of the UPOU community.
